This is a lab manual for differential calculus courses that use group activities (labs) as a major component of the course. It is not a intended to be used as a textbook. To see it in use, visit spot.pcc.edu/math/clm/. If you end up using this in your own courses, please try to get your own copy up and running at your own address, for various reasons. If you are at a small institution though, and have no one to turn to for such technical assistance, then you are welcome to use our copy.  I'd appreciate it if you just send me a heads up email. 

This project uses MathBook XML (http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/) to convert source XML files into HTML and TEX (and PDF) output files. For some help getting started on an MBX project, see https://spaces.pcc.edu/display/MS/Getting+Started+with+an+MBX+Project. (No promises that the information there is curated well.) 

Once you have mathbook installed, executing `src/destroy-and-rebuild-all` from this project will create all of the html files, the knowls folder, printdraft.tex, printcolordraft.tex, and screenpdfdraft.tex. Then executing `src/compileall` will run xelatex twice on those three .tex files, giving pdfs. The cover page is (currently) a spearate pdf inside src/, which I just attach to the print versions using Adobe.

Everything in the src/images folder comes with the distribution, and is referenced by the html files and knowls. If you modify source for an image, or if you insert or remove images (thus changing their reference ids), you will need to re-create the images. To do that, run `mathbook/script/mbx -c latex-image -f all -d <full path to src/images> <full path to src/clm.xml>`. Also, the few images that have gradient shading need special treatment for their svg, png, and eps versions to come out right. For them, find their .tex files in the images folder. Edit them to remove the (unnecessary) xparse and xltxtra packages. Then compile with pdflatex. Then convert the resulting pdf to svg, png, and eps formats.
