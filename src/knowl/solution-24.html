The discontinuity is not removable.  (The problem is that the limits are different from the left and right of \(3\).) \(f\) is discontinuous from both directions at \(4\) but the discontinuity is removable (\(\lim\limits_{x\to4}\fe{f}{x}=1\)). \(f\) is discontinuous from both directions at \(2\pi\) but the discontinuity is removable (\(\lim\limits_{x\to2\pi}\fe{f}{x}=1\)).</p></span><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="limits-and-continuity-supplementary-exercises.html#solution-24">(in-context)</a></div>
