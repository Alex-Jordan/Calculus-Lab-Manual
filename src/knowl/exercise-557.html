<p>It was a dark night and \(5.5\) ft tall Bahram was walking towards a street lamp whose light was perched \(40\) ft into the air.  As he walked, the light caused a shadow to fall behind Bahram.  When Bahram was \(80\) ft from the base of the lamp he was walking at a pace of \(2\) <sup>ft</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub>.  At what rate was the length of Bahram's shadow changing at that instant?   Make sure that each stated and calculated rate value has the correct sign.   Make sure that your conclusion sentence clearly communicates whether the length of the shadow was increasing or decreasing at the indicated time.</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="related-rates-supplementary-exercises.html#exercise-557">(in-context)</a></div>
