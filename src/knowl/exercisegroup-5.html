<p>Moose and squirrel were having casual conversation when suddenly, without any apparent provocation, Boris Badenov launched anti-moose missile in their direction. Fortunately, squirrel had ability to fly as well as great knowledge of missile technology, and he was able to disarm missile well before it hit ground.</p>
<p>The elevation (ft) of the tip of the missile \(t\) seconds after it was launched is given by the function \(\fe{h}{t}=-16t^2+294.4t+15\).</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-17"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">9</span></h5>
<p>Calculate the value of \(\fe{h}{12}\). What unit is associated with this value? What does the value tell you about the flight of the missile?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>

<p>The velocity (<sup>ft</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>s</sub>) function for the missile is \(\fe{v}{t}=-32t+294.4\). Calculate the value of \(\frac{\fe{v}{10}-\fe{v}{0}}{10}\). What unit is associated with this value? What does this value tell you about the flight of the missile?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>
