<p>Resolve each of the following disputes.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-290"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">15</span></h5>
<p>One day Sara and Jermaine were working on an assignment.  One question asked them to draw a function over the domain \(\ointerval{-2}{\infty}\) with the properties that the function is always increasing and always concave down.  Sara insisted that the curve must have a vertical asymptote at \(-2\) and Jermaine insisted that the function must have a horizontal asymptote somewhere.  Were either of these students correct?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>
<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-291"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">16</span></h5>
<p>The next question Sara and Jermaine encountered described the same function with the added condition that the function is never positive.  Sara and Jermaine made the same contentions about asymptotes.  Is one of them now correct?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>

<p>At another table Pedro and Yoshi were asked to draw a continuous curve that, among other properties, was never concave up.  Pedro said “OK, so the curve is always concave down” to which Yoshi replied “Pedro, you need to open your  mind to other possibilities.”  Who's right?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>
<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-293"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">18</span></h5>
<p>In the next problem Pedro and Yoshi were asked to draw a function that is everywhere continuous and that is concave down at every value of \(x\) <!--Style me with CSS--><em>except</em> \(3\).  Yoshi declared “impossible” and Pedro responded “have some faith, Yosh-man.”  Pedro then began to draw. Is it possible that Pedro came up with such a function?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>
