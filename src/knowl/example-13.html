<p>During the 1990s, the amount of electricity used per day in Etown increased as a function of population at the rate of 18â€¯kW/person.  On July 1, 1997, the population of Etown was \(100{,}000\) and the population was decreasing at a rate of 6 people/day.  In <a href="section-chain-rule-and-leibniz.html#equation-leibniz-chain-example">Equation&nbsp;(6.4.1)</a> we use these values to determine the rate at which electrical usage was changing (with respect to time) in Etown on 7/1/1997.  Please note that in this extremely simplified example we are ignoring all factors that contribute to citywide electrical usage other than population (such as temperature).</p>\begin{equation}\left(18\frac{\text{kW}}{\text{person}}\right)\left(-6\frac{\text{people}}{\text{day}}\right)=-108\frac{\text{kW}}{\text{day}}\label{equation-leibniz-chain-example}\tag{6.4.1}\end{equation}<p>Let's define \(\fe{g}{t}\)  as the population of Etown \(t\) years after January 1, 1990 and \(\fe{f}{u}\) as the daily amount of electricity used in Etown when the population was \(u\).  From the given information, \(\fe{g}{7.5}=100{,}000\), \(\fe{\fd{g}}{7.5}=-6\), and \(\fe{\fd{f}}{u}=18\) for all values of \(u\).  If we let \(y=\fe{f}{u}\) where \(u=\fe{g}{t}\), then we have (from <a href="section-chain-rule-and-leibniz.html#equation-leibniz-chain-example">Equation&nbsp;(6.4.1)</a>):</p>\begin{equation}\left(\lzoa{y}{u}{u=100{,}000}\right)\left(\lzoa{u}{t}{t=7.5}\right)=\lzoa{y}{t}{t=7.5}\label{equation-second-leibniz-chain-example}\tag{6.4.2}\end{equation}<p>You should note that <a href="section-chain-rule-and-leibniz.html#equation-second-leibniz-chain-example">Equation&nbsp;(6.4.2)</a> is an application of the chain rule expressed in Leibniz notation; specifically, the expression on the left side of the equal sign represents \(\fe{\fd{f}}{\fe{g}{7.5}}\fe{\fd{g}}{7.5}\).</p></article><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="section-chain-rule-and-leibniz.html#example-13">(in-context)</a></div>
