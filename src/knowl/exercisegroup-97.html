<p>Portions of SW 35th Avenue are extremely hilly.  Suppose that you are riding your bike along SW 35th Ave from Vermont Street to Capitol Highway.  Let \(u=\fe{d}{t}\) be the distance you have traveled (ft) where \(t\) is the number of seconds that have passed since you began your journey.  Suppose that \(y=\fe{e}{u}\) is the elevation (m) of SW 35th Ave where \(u\) is the distance (ft) from Vermont St headed towards Capitol Highway.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-474"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">7</span></h5>
