<span class="solution"><span class="heading"><span class="type">Solution</span> <span class="codenumber">4.7.1.0.14.1</span></span><p>The unit for \(\fe{\fd{V}}{45}\) is <sup>gal</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub> and the unit for \(\fe{\sd{V}}{45}\) is \(\frac{\sfrac{\text{gal}}{\text{s}}}{\text{s}}\). Since the amount of water left in the tank is decreasing, the value of \(\fe{\fd{V}}{45}\) cannot be positive. The <!--Style me with CSS--><em>average</em> drainage rate is \(60\) <sup>gal</sup>⁄<sub>min</sub> which is equivalent to \(1\) <sup>gal</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub>. Initially the tank drains faster than this average rate, and towards the end of the drainage the tank is draining slower than this average rate.  Since \(45\) seconds is early in the drainage process the drainage rate is almost certainly greater than the average rate of \(1\) <sup>gal</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub>.  Hence the most realistic value for \(\fe{\fd{V}}{45}\) is \(-1.2\) <sup>gal</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub>.</p></span><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="functions-derivatives-antiderivatives-supplementary-exercises.html#solution-91">(in-context)</a></div>
