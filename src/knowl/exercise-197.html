Akbar did some calculations and decided that the value of \(\fe{\fd{V}}{20}\) was (without unit) \(1.5\). Nguyen took one look at Akbar's value and said “that's wrong” What is it about Akbar's value that caused Nguyen to dismiss it as wrong?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="section-derivative-units.html#exercise-197">(in-context)</a></div>
