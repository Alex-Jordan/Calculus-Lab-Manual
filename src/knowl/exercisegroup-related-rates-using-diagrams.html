<p>Three related rates problems are stated below. Each of the problems can be modeled using a right triangle. The sole task in this problem is to identify which pieces of the triangle correspond to quantity-variables and which piece of the triangle (if any) remains constant as the other pieces change.</p>
<p>For each problem, you need to identify which two or three pieces of the triangle correspond to quantity-variables and which pieces remain constant or are not relevant. For each problem, draw a right triangle and label the pieces appropriately (finally a <abbr class="acronym"><!--Style me-->D</abbr> for Diagram). When you are done, any given triangle should either have two pieces labeled as variables and one piece labeled with a constant value or three pieces labeled as variables.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-triangle-first"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">1</span></h5>
<p>A jet is climbing at a constant airspeed of \(430\) mph and at a constant angle of elevation of \(12\) °. At what rate is the elevation of the jet changing when the jet is \(2640\) ft above the ground? (Assume that the ground elevation below the jet's path does not change as the jet makes its climb.)</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>

<p>A \(17\) ft ladder is propped against a very tall wall but the top of the ladder is slipping down the wall. At the moment the top of the ladder is \(12\) ft above the ground it is slipping at the rate of \(0.2\) <sup>ft</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub>. At what rate is the distance between the foot of the ladder and the wall changing at that moment?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>

<p>In Kansas, Highway A runs due north-south for \(125\) miles and Highway B runs dues east-west for \(222\) miles. The elevation of both highways is constantly \(725\) feet their entire lengths. The highways intersect at a point exactly halfway through their runs. One Tuesday a car is travelling east on Highway B at the constant speed of \(76\) mph and a truck is traveling north on Highway A at a constant speed of \(84\) mph. The car passes through the point of intersection at 4:12 pm and the truck passes through the point of intersection at 4:17 pm. At what rate is the distance between the two vehicles changing at 4:27 that afternoon? Assume that the speeds of the car and truck do not vary at all between 4:10 pm and 4:30 pm.</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>
