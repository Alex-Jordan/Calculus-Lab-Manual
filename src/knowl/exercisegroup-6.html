<p>Timmy lived a long life in the 19th century. When Timmy was seven he found a rock that weighed exactly half a stone. (Timmy lived in jolly old England, don't you know.) That rock sat on Timmy's window sill for the next 80 years and wouldn't you know the weight of that rock did not change even one smidge the entire time. In fact, the weight function for this rock was \(\fe{w}{t}=0.5\) where \(\fe{w}{t}\) was the weight of the rock (stones) and \(t\) was the number of years that had passed since that day Timmy brought the rock home.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-20"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">12</span></h5>
<p>What was the average rate of change in the weight of the rock over the 80 years it sat on Timmy's window sill?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>

<p>Ignoring the unit, simplify the expression \(\frac{\fe{w}{t_1}-\fe{w}{t_0}}{t_1-t_0}\). Does the result make sense in the context of this problem?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>

<p>Showing each step in the process and ignoring the unit, simplify the difference quotient for \(w\). Does the result make sense in the context of this problem?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>
