<ul style="list-style-type: ;">
<li style="width:45%; float:left;clear: left;">The function is positive.<br>This means that the vertical-coordinate of the point on the function is positive. As such, a function is positive whenever it lies above the horizontal axis.</li>
<li style="width:45%; float:left;">The function is increasing.<br>This means that the vertical-coordinate of the function consistently increases as you move along the curve from left to right. Linear functions with positive slope are always increasing.</li>
<li style="width:45%; float:left;clear: left;">The function is concave up.<br>A function is concave up at \(a\) if the tangent line to the function at \(a\) lies below the curve. An upward opening parabola is everywhere concave up.</li>
<li style="width:45%; float:left;">The function is negative.<br>This means that the vertical-coordinate of the point on the function is negative. As such, a function is negative whenever it lies below the horizontal axis.</li>
<li style="width:45%; float:left;clear: left;">The function is decreasing.<br>This means that the vertical-coordinate of the function consistently decreases as you move along the curve from left to right. Linear functions with negative slope are always decreasing.</li>
<li style="width:45%; float:left;">The function is concave down.<br>A function is concave down at \(a\) if the tangent line to the function at \(a\) lies above the curve. A downward opening parabola is everywhere concave down.</li>
