<p>The function \(y=\fe{\sin}{x}\) is an example of a periodic function.  Specifically, the function has a period of \(2\pi\) because over any interval of length \(2\pi\) the behavior of the function is exactly the same as it was the previous interval of length \(2\pi\).  A little more precisely, \(\fe{\sin}{x+2\pi}=\fe{\sin}{x}\) regardless of the value of \(x\).</p>
<p>Jasmine was thinking and told her lab assistant that derivatives and antiderivatives of periodic functions must also be periodic.  Jasmine's lab assistant told her that she was half right.  Which half did Jasmine have correct?  Also, draw a function that illustrates that the other half of Jasmine's statement is not correct.</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="section-antiderivatives.html#exercise-266">(in-context)</a></div>
