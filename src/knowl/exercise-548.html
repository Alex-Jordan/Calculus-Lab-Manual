<p>As salt water boils, the only thing that evaporates is the water—the amount of salt in the mixture remains constant. As a consequence, the concentration of the salt in the mixture increases over time.</p>
<p>Suppose that the concentration of salt in a pot of boiling water is given by \(C=\frac{200}{V}\) where \(C\) is the concentration of salt in the mixture (<sup>mg</sup>⁄<sub>L</sub>) and \(V\) is the total amount of mixture in the pot (L). Determine the rate at which the salt concentration is changing at the moment there are \(5.2\) L of liquid in the pot if at that moment water is evaporating at the rate of \(0.13\) <sup>L</sup>⁄<sub></sub>.</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="section-introduction-related-rates.html#exercise-548">(in-context)</a></div>
