<p>At 2:00 PM one day, Muffin and Rex were sleeping atop one another.  A loud noise startled the animals and Muffin began to run due north at a constant rate of \(1.7\) <sup>ft</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub> while Rex ran due east at a constant rate of \(2.1\) <sup>ft</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub>.  The critters maintained these paths and rates for several seconds. Calculate the rate at which the distance between the cat and dog was changing three seconds into their run.</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="related-rates-supplementary-exercises.html#exercise-555">(in-context)</a></div>
