<p>Suppose that water is being drained from each  of the containers at a constant rate.  Let \(h_a\), \(h_b\), and \(h_c\) be the heights (measured in cm) of the liquid remaining in the containers \(t\) seconds after the water began to drain.  What would you expect the sign to be on the second derivative functions \(\sd{h_a}\), \(\sd{h_b}\), and \(\sd{h_c}\)  while the containers are being drained?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="section-higher-order-derivatives.html#exercise-257">(in-context)</a></div>
