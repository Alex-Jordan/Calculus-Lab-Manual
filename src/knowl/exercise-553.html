<p>When working with “common knowledge” formulas, it is important to identify which variables in the formula are really relevant to the stated problem and to then eliminate any irrelevant variables from the formula. Consider the following problem. <blockquote>Slushy is flowing out of the bottom of a cup at the constant rate of \(0.9\) <sup>cm<sup>3</sup></sup>⁄<sub>s</sub>. The cup is the shape of a right circular cone. The height of the cup is \(12\) cm and the radius at the top of the cup is \(3\) cm. Determine the rate at which the depth of the remaining slushy changes at the instant there are exactly \(8\pi\) cm<sup>3</sup> of slushy remaining in the cup.</blockquote></p>
<p>The presence of the cubic-centimeter unit indicates that the problem is rooted in a volume formula. Specifically, we need the volume formula for a right circular cone which is \(V=\frac{\pi}{3}r^2h\) where \(r\) is the radius at the top of the cone and \(h\) is the height of the cone.</p>
<p>In the stated problem, we are told the rate at which the volume of the remaining slushy changes and we are asked to determine the rate at which the depth of the remaining slushy changes. The rates correspond to \(\lz{V}{t}\) and \(\lz{h}{t}\) where \(V\) and \(h\) are, respectively, the volume (cm<sup>3</sup>) and depth (cm) of the slushy that remains in the cup \(t\) seconds after the slushy begins to flow out of the bottom of the cup.</p>
<p>Since the value of \(\lz{r}{t}\) is neither given nor desired, we need to eliminate the variable \(r\) from the formula \(V=\frac{\pi}{3}r^2h\). We do this by exploiting a property of similar triangles. Two triangles are said to be similar if and only if the three angular measurements of the first triangle are identical to the angular measurements of the second triangle. One thing that is always true about similar triangles is that their corresponding sides are proportional. This latter fact is the only reason we are able to define trigonometric functions in terms of the ratios of the sides of a right triangle!</p>

<p>A cross-section of the cup is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/figure-slushy.html" knowl-id="xref-figure-slushy" alt="Figure 8.2.6 " title="Figure 8.2.6 ">Figure 8.2.6</a>. The radius of the cone at the top of the remaining slushy is labeled as \(r\) and the depth of the remaining slushy is labeled as \(h\). The radius at the top of the cup as well as the height of the cup are also shown.</p></article>

<p>Use the fact that the two right triangles in <a knowl="./knowl/figure-slushy.html" knowl-id="xref-figure-slushy" alt="Figure 8.2.6 " title="Figure 8.2.6 ">Figure 8.2.6</a> are similar to write a proportion that relates \(r\), \(h\), \(3\) cm, and \(12\) cm. Solve that equation for \(r\) and substitute the resultant formula into \(V=\frac{\pi}{3}r^2h\). Simplify the resultant formula of \(h\); that's the actual volume formula you want to use while solving the related rates problem—the formula that relates \(V\) and \(h\).</p>
<p>Go ahead and solve the related rates problem.</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="section-diagrams-for-related-rates.html#exercise-553">(in-context)</a></div>
