<p>One day Sara and Jermaine were working on an assignment.  One question asked them to draw a function over the domain \(\ointerval{-2}{\infty}\) with the properties that the function is always increasing and always concave down.  Sara insisted that the curve must have a vertical asymptote at \(-2\) and Jermaine insisted that the function must have a horizontal asymptote somewhere.  Were either of these students correct?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="section-graphical-features-from-derivatives.html#exercise-290">(in-context)</a></div>
