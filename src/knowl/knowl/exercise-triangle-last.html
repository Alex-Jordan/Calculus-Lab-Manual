<p>In Kansas, Highway A runs due north-south for \(125\) miles and Highway B runs dues east-west for \(222\) miles. The elevation of both highways is constantly \(725\) feet their entire lengths. The highways intersect at a point exactly halfway through their runs. One Tuesday a car is travelling east on Highway B at the constant speed of \(76\) mph and a truck is traveling north on Highway A at a constant speed of \(84\) mph. The car passes through the point of intersection at 4:12 pm and the truck passes through the point of intersection at 4:17 pm. At what rate is the distance between the two vehicles changing at 4:27 that afternoon? Assume that the speeds of the car and truck do not vary at all between 4:10 pm and 4:30 pm.</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="section-diagrams-for-related-rates.html#exercise-triangle-last">(in-context)</a></div>
