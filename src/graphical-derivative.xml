    <title>Graphical Derivatives</title>

    <p>Much information about a function's first derivative can be gleaned simply by looking at a graph of the function. In fact, a person with good visual skills can <q>see</q> the graph of the derivative while looking at the graph of the function. This activity focuses on helping you develop that skill.</p>

                <p>A parabolic function is shown in <xref ref="figure-graphical-derivative"/>. The next several questions are in reference to that function.</p>

The first derivative of each function (the dash-dotted curves) have been drawn over the interval <m>\ointerval{0}{7}</m>. Use the given portion of the first derivative together with the symmetry of the function to help you draw each first derivative over the interval <m>\ointerval{-7}{0}</m>. Please note that a function that is symmetric across a vertical line has a first derivative that is symmetric about a point.  Similarly, a function that is symmetric about a point has a first derivative that is symmetric across a vertical line.</p>
