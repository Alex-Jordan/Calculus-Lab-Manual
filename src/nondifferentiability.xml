    <title>Nondifferentiability</title>

    <p>A function is said to be nondifferentiable at any value its first derivative is undefined.  There are three graphical behaviors that lead to non-differentiability.</p>

    <ul> 
        <li><m>f</m> is nondifferentiable at <m>a</m> if <m>f</m> is discontinuous at <m>a</m>.</li> 
        <li><m>f</m> is nondifferentiable at <m>a</m> if the slope of <m>f</m> is different from the left and right at <m>a</m>.</li> 
        <li><m>f</m> is nondifferentiable at <m>a</m> if <m>f</m> has a vertical tangent line at <m>a</m>.</li> 
    </ul>

                            <description>a graph of a function whose curve has two segments; the first segment enters from the left at about (-7,4), moving rightward and slightly downward; it becomes more and more steep until at x=-4, it is briefly vertical; it then loses its steepness and continues moving downward and to the right reaching (-3,-1); here it sharply bends into a straight line, connecting to (-1,3); there is a solid dot at (-1,3), and this segment ends here; the second segment begins at (-1,-5) with a hollow dot; fromt here it connects to (4,5) with a straight line; here it sharply bends downward to a straight line with slope -4, and exits the graph near the lower right corner</description>
