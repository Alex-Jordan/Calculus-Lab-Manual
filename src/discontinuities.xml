    <title>Discontinuities</title>

    <p>When a function has a discontinuity at <m>a</m>, the function is sometimes continuous from only the right or only the left at <m>a</m>. (Please note that when we say <q>the function is continuous at <m>a</m></q> we mean that the function is continuous from <em>both</em> the right and left at <m>a</m>.)</p>

        <title>One-sided Continuity</title>
        <statement>
            <p>The function <m>f</m> is continuous from the left at <m>a</m> if and only if <me>\lim\limits_{x\to a^{-}}\fe{f}{x}=\fe{f}{a}\text{.}</me></p>
            <p>The function <m>f</m> is continuous from the right at <m>a</m> if and only if <me>\lim\limits_{x\to a^{+}}\fe{f}{x}=\fe{f}{a}\text{.}</me></p>
        </statement>
    </definition> 

    <p>Some discontinuities are classified as <term>removable discontinuities</term>. Discontinuities that are holes or skips (holes with a secondary point) are <term>removable</term>.</p>

        <statement>
            <p>We say that <m>f</m> has a removable discontinuity at <m>a</m> if <m>f</m> is discontinuous at <m>a</m> but <m>\lim\limits_{x\to a}\fe{f}{x}</m> exists.</p>

                <p>Referring to the function <m>h</m> shown in <xref ref="figure-discontinuities"/>, state the values of <m>t</m> where the function is continuous from the right but not the left. Then state the values of <m>t</m> where the function is continuous from the left but not the right.</p>
