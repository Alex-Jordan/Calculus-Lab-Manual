    <title>Diagrams for  Related Rates</title>
    <p>A particular challenge when working most related rates problems is identifying the quantity-variables. For example, when working a problem that invloves a right triangle, there are six potential quantity-variables (the lengths of the three sides, the measurements of the two acute angles, and the area). In each related rates problem involving a right triangle, at least two of these measurements must be quantity-variables, or you will not end up with two (or more) rates to relate!</p>
    <example>
        <blockquote><p>A small drone is flying straight upward at the rate of <quantity><mag>0.88</mag><unit base="foot"/><per base="second"/></quantity>. The drone is tethered to the ground (with a lot of slack) at a point that lies <quantity><mag>400</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> west of the launch point of the drone. Assuming that the ground is perfectly level, determine the rate at which the angle of elevation from the tether point to the drone increases at the moment the drone is <quantity><mag>300</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> above ground.</p></blockquote>
        <p>When searching for your quantity-variables, you need to identify sentences or phrases in the problem statement that contain the word <q>rate</q> or something similar (hence the <acro>R</acro> in <acro>DREDS</acro>). There are two such phrases in this problem:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><q>A small drone is flying straight upward at the rate of<ellipsis/></q></p></li>
            <li><p><q><ellipsis/>determine the rate at which the angle of elevation from the tether point to the drone increase<ellipsis/></q></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pieces of the right triangle that correspond to those phrases have been marked in <xref ref="figure-drone-triangle"/> as, respectively, <m>h</m> and <m>\theta</m>. The distance between the tether point and launch point remains constant, hence the side labeled as <m>400</m>. Please note that there should be no other annotations of any kind on this diagram. If writing other numbers down helps you think through the problem, draw a second triangle on your scratch paper and annotate that in any way the helps. That said, you need a clean variable diagram in your solution, so leave <xref ref="figure-drone-triangle"/> as it is.</p>

                <p>Three related rates problems are stated below. Each of the problems can be modeled using a right triangle. The sole task in this problem is to identify which pieces of the triangle correspond to quantity-variables and which piece of the triangle (if any) remains constant as the other pieces change.</p>
                <p>For each problem, you need to identify which two or three pieces of the triangle correspond to quantity-variables and which pieces remain constant or are not relevant. For each problem, draw a right triangle and label the pieces appropriately (finally a <acro>D</acro> for Diagram). When you are done, any given triangle should either have two pieces labeled as variables and one piece labeled with a constant value or three pieces labeled as variables.</p>

                <p>When working with <q>common knowledge</q> formulas, it is important to identify which variables in the formula are really relevant to the stated problem and to then eliminate any irrelevant variables from the formula. Consider the following problem.</p>
                <blockquote><p>Slushy is flowing out of the bottom of a cup at the constant rate of <quantity><mag>0.9</mag><unit prefix="centi" base="meter" exp="3"/><per base="second"/></quantity>. The cup is the shape of a right circular cone. The height of the cup is <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity> and the radius at the top of the cup is <quantity><mag>3</mag><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>. Determine the rate at which the depth of the remaining slushy changes at the instant there are exactly <quantity><mag>8\pi</mag><unit prefix="centi" base="meter" exp="3"/></quantity> of slushy remaining in the cup.</p></blockquote>
                <p>The presence of the cubic-centimeter unit indicates that the problem is rooted in a volume formula. Specifically, we need the volume formula for a right circular cone which is <m>V=\frac{\pi}{3}r^2h</m> where <m>r</m> is the radius at the top of the cone and <m>h</m> is the height of the cone.</p>
                <p>In the stated problem, we are told the rate at which the volume of the remaining slushy changes and we are asked to determine the rate at which the depth of the remaining slushy changes. The rates correspond to <m>\lz{V}{t}</m> and <m>\lz{h}{t}</m> where <m>V</m> and <m>h</m> are, respectively, the volume (<quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter" exp="3"/></quantity>) and depth (<quantity><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>) of the slushy that remains in the cup <m>t</m> seconds after the slushy begins to flow out of the bottom of the cup.</p>
                <p>Since the value of <m>\lz{r}{t}</m> is neither given nor desired, we need to eliminate the variable <m>r</m> from the formula <m>V=\frac{\pi}{3}r^2h</m>. We do this by exploiting a property of similar triangles. Two triangles are said to be similar if and only if the three angular measurements of the first triangle are identical to the angular measurements of the second triangle. One thing that is always true about similar triangles is that their corresponding sides are proportional. This latter fact is the only reason we are able to define trigonometric functions in terms of the ratios of the sides of a right triangle!</p>

                        <p>A cross-section of the cup is shown in <xref ref="figure-slushy"/>. The radius of the cone at the top of the remaining slushy is labeled as <m>r</m> and the depth of the remaining slushy is labeled as <m>h</m>. The radius at the top of the cup as well as the height of the cup are also shown.</p>

                <p>Use the fact that the two right triangles in <xref ref="figure-slushy"/> are similar to write a proportion that relates <m>r</m>, <m>h</m>, <quantity><mag>3</mag><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>, and <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>. Solve that equation for <m>r</m> and substitute the resultant formula into <m>V=\frac{\pi}{3}r^2h</m>. Simplify the resultant formula of <m>h</m>; that's the actual volume formula you want to use while solving the related rates problem<mdash/>the formula that relates <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>.</p>
                <p>Go ahead and solve the related rates problem.</p>
