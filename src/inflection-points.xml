    <title>Inflection Points</title>

    <p>When searching for inflection points on a function, you can narrow your search by identifying numbers where the function is continuous (from both directions) and the second derivative is either zero or undefined.  (By definition an inflection point cannot occur at a number where the function is not continuous from both directions.)  You can then build a sign table for the second derivative that implies the concavity of the given function.</p>

    <p>When performing this analysis, you need to simplify the second derivative formula in the same way you simplify the first derivative formula when looking for critical numbers and local extreme points.</p>
