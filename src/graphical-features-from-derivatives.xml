    <title>Graphical Features from Derivatives</title>

    <p>When given a function formula, we  often find the first and second derivative formulas to determine behaviors of the given function.  In a later lab we will use the first and second derivative formulas to help us graph a function given the formula for the function.  One thing we do with the derivative formulas is determine where they are positive, negative, zero, and undefined. This helps us determine where the given function is increasing, decreasing, concave up, concave down, and linear.</p>

                <p>You should know by now that the first derivative  continually increases over intervals where the second derivative is constantly positive and that the first derivative continually decreases over intervals where the second derivative is constantly negative.  A person might infer from this that a function changes more and more quickly over intervals where the second derivative is constantly positive and that a function changes more and more slowly over intervals where the second derivative is constantly negative.   We are going to explore that idea in this problem.</p>

                   <p>One day Sara and Jermaine were working on an assignment.  One question asked them to draw a function over the domain <m>\ointerval{-2}{\infty}</m> with the properties that the function is always increasing and always concave down.  Sara insisted that the curve must have a vertical asymptote at <m>-2</m> and Jermaine insisted that the function must have a horizontal asymptote somewhere.  Were either of these students correct?</p>

                    <p>The next question Sara and Jermaine encountered described the same function with the added condition that the function is never positive.  Sara and Jermaine made the same contentions about asymptotes.  Is one of them now correct?</p>

Yoshi declared <q>impossible</q> and Pedro responded <q>have some faith, Yosh-man.</q>  Pedro then began to draw. Is it possible that Pedro came up with such a function?</p>
