    <title>Logarithmic Differentiation</title>

    <p>You have formulas that allow you to differentiate <m>x^2</m>, <m>2^x</m>, and <m>2^2</m>.  You don't, however, have a formula to differentiate <m>x^x</m>.  In this section you are going to use a process called <term>logarithmic differentiation</term> to determine the derivative formula for the function <m>y=x^x</m>.  <xref ref="example-logarithmic-differentitation"/> shows this process for a different function.</p>

    <p>With logarithmic differentiation, when <m>y</m> is written as a function of <m>x</m>, especially one involving only products, quotients, and powers, begin by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation relating <m>y</m> to <m>x</m>. This technique will usually only be helpful if the logarithm rules allow you to break up the right side some. Proceed to differentiate each side with respect to <m>x</m>. On the left side, respect the rules for implicit differentiation. Once this is done, algebraically solve for <m>\lz{y}{x}</m>. If there are any instance of <m>y</m> left, replace them with th original expression in <m>x</m>.</p>

    <p>In the olden days (before symbolic calculators) we would use the process of logarithmic differentiation to find derivative formulas for complicated functions.  The reason this process is <q>simpler</q> than straight forward differentiation is that we can obviate the need for the product and quotient rules if we completely expand the logarithmic expression before taking the derivative.</p>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>The function <m>y=x^x</m> is only defined for positive values of <m>x</m> (which in turn means <m>y</m> is also positive), so we can say that <m>\fe{\ln}{y}=\fe{\ln}{x^x}</m>.  Use implicit differentiation to find a formula for <m>\lz{y}{x}</m> <em>after first applying the power rule of logarithms to the logarithmic expression on the right side of the equal sign</em>.  Once you have your formula for <m>\lz{y}{x}</m>, substitute <m>x^x</m> for <m>y</m>. Voila!  You will have the derivative formula for <m>x^x</m>.  So go ahead and do it.</p>
