    <title>Discontinuous Formulas</title>

    <p>Discontinuities are a little more challenging to identify when working with formulas than when working with graphs. One reason for the added difficulty is that when working with a function formula you have to dig into your memory bank and retrieve fundamental properties about certain types of functions.</p>
