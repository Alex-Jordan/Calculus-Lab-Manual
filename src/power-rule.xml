    <title>The Power Rule</title>

    <p>The first differentiation rule we are going to explore is called <term>the power rule of differentiation</term>. <men>\lzoo{x}{x^n}=n\,x^{n-1}</men> When <m>n</m> is a positive integer, it is fairly easy to establish this rule using <xref ref="definition-first-derivative"/>.  The proof of the rule gets a little more complicated when <m>n</m> is negative, fractional, or irrational.  For purposes of this lab, we are going to just accept the rule as valid.</p>

    <p>This rule is one you just <q>do in your head</q> and then write down the result.  Three examples of what you would be expected to write when differentiating power functions are shown in <xref ref="table-power-rule"/>.</p>

    <p>Notice that the type of notation used when naming the derivative is dictated by the manner in which the original function is expressed.  For example, <m>y=x^7</m> is telling us the relationship between two variables; in this situation we name the derivative using the notation <m>\lz{y}{x}</m>.  On the other hand, function notation is being used to name the rule in <m>\fe{f}{t}=\sqrt[3]{t^7}</m>; in this situation we name the derivative using the function notation <m>\fe{\fd{f}}{t}</m>.</p>
