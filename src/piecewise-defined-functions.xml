    <title>Piecewise-Defined Functions</title>

    <p>Piecewise-defined functions are functions where the formula used depends upon the value of the input. When looking for discontinuities on piecewise-defined functions, you need to investigate the behavior at values where the formula changes as well as values where the issues discussed in <xref ref="section-discontinuous-formulas"/> might pop up.</p>

            <introduction>
                <p>This question is all about the function <m>f</m> defined by <m>\fe{f}{x}=\begin{cases}\frac{4}{5-x}&amp;x\lt1\\\frac{x-3}{x-3}&amp;1\lt x\lt4\\2x+1&amp;4\leq x\leq7\\\frac{15}{8-x}&amp;x\gt7\text{.}\end{cases}</m></p>

                <p>Answer <xref ref="exercise-first-piecewise"/> at each of the values <m>1,3,4,5,7</m>, and <m>8</m>. At the values where the answer to <xref ref="exercise-first-piecewise"/> is yes, go ahead and answer <xref autoname="plural" ref="exercise-second-piecewise"/><ndash/><xref autoname="no" ref="exercise-last-piecewise"/>; skip <xref autoname="plural" ref="exercise-second-piecewise"/><ndash/><xref autoname="no" ref="exercise-last-piecewise"/> at the values where the answer to <xref ref="exercise-first-piecewise"/> is no.</p>
