    <title>Not Simplifying First</title>

    <p>As always, you want to simplify an expression before jumping in to take its derivative.  Nevertheless, it can build confidence to see that the rules work even if you don't simplify first.</p>

            <introduction> 
                <p>Consider the functions <m>\fe{f}{x}=\sqrt{x^2}</m> and <m>\fe{g}{x}=\left(\sqrt{x}\right)^2</m>.</p>

                <statement> 
                    <p>Assuming that <m>x</m> is not negative, how does each of these formulas simplify?  Use the simplified formula to find the formulas for <m>\fe{\fd{f}}{x}</m> and <m>\fe{\fd{g}}{x}</m>.</p>

                    <p>Use the chain rule (without first simplifying) to find the formulas for <m>\fe{\fd{f}}{x}</m> and <m>\fe{\fd{g}}{x}</m>; simplify each result (assuming that <m>x</m> is positive).</p>

                <p>So long as <m>x</m> falls on the interval <m>\ointerval{-\frac{\pi}{2}}{\frac{\pi}{2}}</m>, <m>\fe{\tan^{-1}}{\fe{\tan}{x}}=x</m>. Use the chain rule to find <m>\lzoo{x}{\fe{\tan^{-1}}{\fe{\tan}{x}}}</m> and show that it simplifies as it should.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>How does the formula <m>\fe{g}{t}=\fe{\ln}{e^{5t}}</m> simplify and what does this tell you about the formula for <m>\fe{\fd{g}}{t}</m>?  After answering those questions use the chain rule to find the formula for <m>\fe{\fd{g}}{t}</m> and show that it simplifies as it should.</p>

                    <p>Use the quotient, product, and power rules <em>of logarithms</em> to expand the formula for <m>\fe{g}{t}</m> into three logarithmic terms.  Then find <m>\fe{\fd{g}}{t}</m> by taking the derivative of the expanded version of <m>g</m>. </p>
